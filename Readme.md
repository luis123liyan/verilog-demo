### This project is the basic usage of verilog
### The code is compiled with iverilog and displayed with GTKWave.
### First you have to install iverilog and GTKWave

```
sudo apt-get install iverilog
sudo apt-get install gtkwave
```

### For each project I have written shell scripts you just need to run

```
bash compile.sh
```
